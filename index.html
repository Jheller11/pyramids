        <p>How to Play: <br>1. Select the top block from any column by clicking on that column. <br>2. Select a column to place the block in.</p>
        <p>To win, move blocks from the first column to the last column given the following rules:<br>
            1. You may only move one block at a time.<br> 2. You may not place a larger block on top of a smaller block.</p>
    </div> <!-- I've never been a fan of line breaks, I would make these all separate p tags, but I suppose to each their own -->
    <div class="topScore">Best Score: Jeff - Total Moves: 31</div> <!-- I would make this part of instructions and make this a p tag -->
    <a href="game.html" class="block"> <br>START GAME!</a>
    <!-- I would do away with the line break and put the link inside a p tag and adjust line height or something like that -->

<!-- Nice job on the html file.  I like that you included a separate file for instructions. -->
<!-- Only thing I would say is that the font is a little small, but that's just me -->
